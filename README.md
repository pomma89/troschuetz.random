Troschuetz.Random
=================

*Fully managed library providing various random number generators and distributions.*

## Introduction ##

All the hard work behind this library was done by Stefan Troschütz, and for which I thank him very much. What I have done with his great project, was simply to refactor and improve his code, while offering a new Python-style random class.

Please visit the [page of the original project](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15102/NET-random-number-generators-and-distributions) in order to get an overview of the contents of this library. Unluckily, linked article also contains the only documentation available.

## Tester ##

A simple, yet effective, WinForms application is available in order to test the Troschuetz.Random library. As for the rest of the code, that application was completelly written by Stefan Troschütz and what I did was simply to adapt it to the new refactored code.

The tester is not distributed on NuGet, but it can be [downloaded here](TODO).
